# Flame-Diagnostics
Flame Diagnostics through image processing
Study of diffusion flame and premixed flame is done to get a better understanding of the experiments.

Experiment 1 : 
I. Writing a matlab code to calculate the flame height 
II. Performing experiment in the lab 
III. Calculation of the Image height using matlab 
IV. Calculation of image height using Roper’s empirical formula

Experiment 2 : 
I. Calculation of Laminar Burning Velocity 
● Angle Method 
● Area Method 
II. Calculation of Laminar Burning Velocity Using Abel inversion 
III. Intensity Distribution at Different Axial Locations of Flame

MATLAB app is also attached "Flame_Diagnostic_App.mlapp"
